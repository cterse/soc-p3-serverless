Instructions for using the adapter:

1) Creating virtual environement
	sudo apt-get install python-virtualenv
	mkdir myproject
	cd myproject
	python3 -m venv venv

2) Activating virtual environment
	. venv/bin/activate

3) Installing Flask
	pip install Flask

3) Putting files into myproject folder. Files include configuration.txt, protocol.txt, adapter.py and any agents that are to be tested.

4) Download and install sqlite3 
	sudo apt-get install sqlite3

5) Download and install browser for managing databases in sqlite3.
	sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:linuxgndu/sqlitebrowser
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install sqlitebrowser

6) Search you machine for the installed DB Browser and launch it. You can search it as “DB Browser for SQLite”. Then click “New Database” and specify where you are going to store this Database file. Remember the path to you Database file.

7) Update the agent’s implementation to include:
import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect('/home/daria/Documents/test/test') ←---- replace this path to you Database file with the one you’ve remembered in step 6.

8) Go into your agent’s implementation and update the path to files “configuration.txt” and “protocol.txt” if they are NOT in the same folder as python files.

9) In order to run the agent you have to tell Flask which python file to run, therefore execute the following command in your shell, replacing the agent’s python file:
export FLASK_APP=merchant-pos.py 

10) To run the agent using Flask execute the following command in shell:
	flask run

comment: By default it will use host 127.0.0.1:5000, however, if you run multiple flask agents at the same time, they must have different addresses, so do that by running “flask run --host=127.0.0.2:5000” instead, specifying any address you want your agent to have – this should also match agent’s address specified configuration.txt file.
