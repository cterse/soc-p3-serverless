* Serverless Protocols

  This directory contains the source for several "stacks" for deployment with the Serverless Framework.

** Stacks
   Each subdirectory is a separate stack, which means it is deployed separately to AWS.

   - layers :: a stack for separating out dependencies that don't need to be updated everytime the other stacks are updated
   - logistics :: a stack for the logistics scenario

** Setup
   1. Install serverless
      #+begin_src sh
      npm install -g serverless
      #+end_src
   2. Configure serverless with your AWS credentials
   3. Set up other resources
      E.g. RDS, etc.
   4. Deploy
      A. Deploy the deps layer first
        #+begin_src
        cd serverless/layers/deps
        sls deploy
        #+end_src
      B. Deploy the logistics stack
        #+begin_src
        cd serverless/logistics
        sls deploy
        #+end_src
   5. Invoke
      #+begin_src
      sls invoke -f hello
      #+end_src
